            Photography began around 1800 by Thomas Wedgewood who used paper treated with light-sensative silver nitrate but the results were faint and were not permanent. In the 1820s Nicéphore Niépce, was able to make the first permanent photoetching, but these required very long exposures. During the rest of the 19th century improvements were made using glass plates. Beginning in 1876, the use of paper film was improved with nitrate film and later acetate film. Film photography remained the dominant in photography, starting with black-and-white &amp; later color, until the early 21st century when digital began to dominate.

            In 1981, Sony introduced the first consumer digital camera, using a <abbr title="charge-coupled device">CCD</abbr> image sensor replacing the film. Also the post-capture processing of film via chemical development is replaced with nuch easier and flexible computer manipulation. The advantages of digital photography include: reduced cost as film no longer needs to purchased and chemical development is eliminated, immediate review of images is possible with digital, many more images can be stored in the same physical volume with memory cards as compared to photographic film, image processing is much more consistent, flexible, and easier. In addition, distribution of images is much easier with the internet and websites such as Flickr,  Picasa, and others.

            The image taking process is the same between film and digital photography as the difference is in the light-sensing mechanism. Film and digital cameras have nearly identical controls and features that influence the image produced.
